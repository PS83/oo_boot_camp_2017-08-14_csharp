  JetBrains ReSharper for C#

Create a directory for labs:
  oo_boot_camp_YYYY-MM-DD_csharp
  
In Visual Studio, create a new solution:
  File / New / Project...
    Visual C# / Class Library <without modifiers/qualifiers>
    Name: OoBootCamp
    Location: The labs directory you created above
    Solution: OoBootCamp
    _uncheck_ Create directory for solution (no new directory, please)
  An empty class (Class1) gets created. Ignore it for now.

In Visual Studio, create a test project:
  File / Add / New Project...
    Visual C# / Class Library <without modifiers/qualifiers>
    Name: OoBootCamp.Tests
    Location: The labs directory you created above
  Another empty class (Class1) gets created. Ignore it also for now.

Now we need to create a dependency of the tests on the source code.
In Visual Studio, open the solution properties:
  Selection "Solution 'OoBootCamp'" in the Solution Explorer
  Right click on the solution, and select "Properties"
  In 'Common Properties', select 'Startup Project'
    Single startup project: OoBootCamp.tests
  In 'Project Dependencies', select the 'Projects: OoBootCamp.Tests'
    Check the 'Depends on: OoBootCamp', and click OK

We use NUnit for our unit tests. It needs to be installed into the 
OoBootCamp.Tests project. Use NuGet to fetch it:
  Select (click on) the OoBootCamp.Tests in the Solution Explorer. Then select:
    Tools / NuGet Package Manager / Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...
      Browse tab
        Enter 'NUnit' in the Search field
        Select NUnit by Charlie Poole
          For Version:, select latest stable
          Click Install
          A console window will show you the progress

Setup the first test, a test of Rectangle:
  Rename the 'Class1' in the OoBootCamp to 'Rectangle' (file and class name)
  Rename the 'Class1' in the OoBootCamp.Tests to 'RectangleTest' (file and class name)
    Just before the class declaration, decorate the class with:
      [TestFixture]
    Let the VS import the NUnit framework for you
    Add an assertion for Rectangle:
      [Test]
      public void Area()
      {
          Assert.AreEqual(24, new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0).Area());
      }
    Let VS use Rectangle from the OoBootCamp project
  Correct the other compile errors, one by one
  When all the compile errors are gone, run the Unit tests:
    ReSharper / Unit Tests / Run All Unit Tests from Solution

Speed hint: Customize the Standard tool bar and add ReSharper's Run All Unit Tests
